* Renderers
  * text and svg renderers should have a common interface
  * text-buffer
    - more efficient representation
    - implement setter function e.g. no more (setf (aref text-buffer ...) ...)
  * cell-colors in SVG renderer
  * SVG images are bloated, due to overlapping lines

* Grid
  * what should be done with DISTANCE-FUNCTION etc? 

* Generators
  * more algos (wilson's algorithm for spanning trees, recursive backtracking)
